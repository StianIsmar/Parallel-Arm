# Parallel-Arm
# Internship Saga Robotics 
The pkm_bringup folder contains a ROS (Robot Operating System) package which was made to control a parallel arm.
The source code is written in C++ and by the use of ROS libraries and tools. The main source code pkm_arm.cpp publishes messages over a
CAN network.

This repository also contains three RoboteQ MicroBasic scripts written for RoboteQ SBL1360 motorcontrollers.
